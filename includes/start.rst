-------------------------------------

The most basic use of Newspack Ads is all about connecting a GAM account and configuring global ad slots using ad units fetched from GAM:

At an entity level, GAM is a :doc:`Provider<./providers/index>`, and the ad slots are possible through :doc:`Placements<./placements>`. These 2 entities are the foundation of the plugin and their extensibility makes our features and 3rd party integrations possible.
